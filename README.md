# 2. Stages

Each stage of the project is described in the following sections.

## 2.1. Assemble team

Assemble a team of 3 students, committed to work together, and enrolled in the same laboratory schedule.

## 2.2. Pick topic area

The specific topic for the project should be selected by the project team.

We suggest that the team starts by selecting one of the following broad topic areas:

1. Smart Buildings  
2. Industry & Supply Chain  
3. Smart Cities  
4. Assisted Living

See [examples of project topics](https://github.com/tecnico-ami/Project-Topics/blob/main/README.md) for each topic area.
You can adapt one of these ideas or propose a new one.

## 2.3 Register team

Go to Fénix and register your team, on the laboratory schedule where all the team members are enrolled.  
You are expected to complete this registration before the first laboratory session.

Even if you do not have a full team yet, attend the first laboratory session, to meet colleagues also looking for a team.

Make sure your photograph is up-to-date and of good quality on Fénix.  
If your photo is not good enough, go to Fénix, Personal, Photograph, hover photo with mouse, Submit Photos.

## 2.4 Present team and idea

In the first laboratory session, each team will present its members and the initial project idea.  
Each team member should have one dedicated slide, featuring their name, concise biography, and prior experience with programming and hardware tinkering, e.g., projects with Arduinos or Raspberry Pis.  
The most important slide will present the initial project idea, including a title and a succinct description.

## 2.5. Write proposal with literature review

After having chosen a topic, your team should prepare a proposal document.
The project proposal should describe the specific problem to address and the proposed solution.

Please bring a draft of the proposal to your next laboratory session to present it and receive feedback.  
IMPORTANT: the proposal document must be submitted on that same week, on the days following the laboratory session.

One of the important parts of the document is the literature review.

### 2.5.1. Literature review

Your proposal must include a (small) literature review, focused on the topic area.
The review will start with a search for relevant scientific papers, where you will learn about the core concepts and approaches to similar solutions.
The bibliography should have 2 (two) papers, from different authors.
These papers must have been published in a scientific journal or conference related with ambient intelligence in the last 3 years.

IMPORTANT: see [list of journals and conferences related with ambient intelligence](https://github.com/tecnico-ami/awesome-ambient-intelligence#publications).  
You can also do an open search on sites like [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) or [Semantic Scholar](https://www.semanticscholar.org/).

### 2.5.2. Technical requirements

The planned project will need to include:

- sensors;
- actuators;
- network communication.

### 2.5.4. Additional document requirements

- PDF format;
- Mandatory file name `CXX_proposal.pdf`;
(where `C` is A for Alameda, T for Tagus, `XX` is the Fenix group number with two digits);
- Report cover: Project title. Headed by course name, group campus, group number.
In the next row: group members sorted by ascending student number.
Include a team photo of the complete team, taken together, at the same physical location, arranged in sequence by ascending student number;
- Report body: The font should be no smaller than 11pt, with standard line and character spacing;
- The use of diagrams (such as UML or SysML) is recommended for clear and concise communication;

- Pages must be numbered (preferably with a label like `Page X of Y`).

## 2.6. Submit and await feedback

Prior to the proposal deadline, submit a ZIP archive containing the proposal document and the literature review papers.

The proposal document will be read by the course faculty and you will receive feedback in the following laboratory session.  
Receiving the feedback is essential so that you can consider the proposal as approved, so be sure to attend in person.
Meanwhile, get started on the project.

## 2.7. Develop project

Develop project milestones over the available weeks.

Attend the lab sessions to present your ongoing development and receive early feedback from the faculty.  
A project that receives regular feedback can avoid mistakes, be improved earlier, and is more likely to achieve a better result.

## 2.8. Prepare demonstration

Write a [`README` file](https://gist.github.com/miguelpardal/dedf25563c37b8fa906fd8cf23b5daae) to be placed in the project's root directory, with step-by-step instructions to assemble and run your project.  
Take photos and record videos showing the project in action.

## 2.9. Write report

The project final report should describe the problem and the implemented solution, along with a presentation of the results.
The report document should update and extend the proposal document to reflect what was actually achieved.

### 2.9.1. Document structure (mandatory)

Same as the proposal, with the following differences:

- Replace _Plan_ (Section 6) with _Conclusion_ (new Section 6).
In it, state which requirements (from Section 3.1) were actually satisfied.
Also, write a summary of the achieved results, with an assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the developed solution;
- Revise all other sections to accurately reflect the final solution.

### 2.9.2. Additional document requirements

The changes to the proposal requirements are the following:

- Mandatory file name `CXX_report.pdf`;
- Target size of 10 pages (including cover and bibliography).

## 2.10. Submit code and report

Prior to the final deadline of the project, submit a ZIP archive containing all the developed code and resources.

IMPORTANT: the code archive and the report are submitted separately on the Fénix system.

### Code archive requirements

- ZIP format - without compiled code, only source and build scripts;
- The mandatory file name is `CXX_solution.zip`;
- `README` file, describing the required platforms, components, software, and setup instructions;
- All configuration files and scripts required to configure the solution on the specified platform;
- All developed source code;
- Existing tests and example files.

## 2.11. Confirm presentation session

The project presentations will occur on the dates following the submission deadline.  
The presentation session calendar will be made available during the final days of the project or after the submission.

Each group is assigned to a session, in their respective campus, preferably in the time-slot of laboratory they are enrolled to.  
If your group requires a change in the proposed slot, please contact faculty by email as soon as possible.

## 2.12. Present and defend

Each group will have to attend the full presentation session where they will present.  
The presentation slides must be in English and the presenters should also present in English.  
For the discussion questions, students can answer in Portuguese.

### 2.12.1. Presentation outline

The presentations will be organized as follows:

- 10 minutes for presentation of the work done, including a mandatory live demonstration  
(also prepare a video of the demonstration, as backup);
- 10 minutes for questions and answers.

It is highly recommended that each presentation includes the following slides:

- general architecture;
- setup process;
- operation process.

Each team member must participate and talk in the presentation, and be prepared to answer individual questions.  
If necessary, a more detailed discussion will be scheduled with each group.

### 2.12.2. Presence

The presentations are done by the whole group, in person, on campus.
Each group must attend from the beginning of their assigned session and remain for the duration of it.

Presenters need to be physically present in the lecture room.
Each student is also invited to attend another full session beyond the one where s/he will present.

### 2.12.3. Presentation archive requirements

IMPORTANT: after making the presentation, submit the presentation and media files on Fénix.

- ZIP format;
- The mandatory file name is `CXX_presentation.zip`;
- Presentation in PDF and also in source format (e.g. PowerPoint);
- Text file `url.txt` containing a download address for `CXX_media.zip`, an archive containing videos, photos, screenshots, and other media of the solution in action.
The link must be valid for one month after submission, at least;
- Optionally, the ZIP may also include an updated README and other files modified after the code submission.

### 2.12.4. Grading

The project grade will take into account:

- Literature review (10%);
- Project design/rational (20%);
- Project implementation (30%);
- Report (20%);
- Presentation (10%);
